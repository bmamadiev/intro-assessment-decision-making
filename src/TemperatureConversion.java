        // Exercise Three - Temperature Converter
        //
        // Build some code which can convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and also from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
        // Based upon the method described here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
        //
        // Step One:
        // First, ask the user what unit they would like to convert to.  f or c
        // Store their answer in a variable.
        //
        // "What would you like to convert to, Celsius or Fahrenheit? Enter c or f..."
        //
        // Step Two:
        // Now, one of two things need to happen.
        // If they entered c, then you need to convert from fahrenheit to celsius.
        // otherwise, if they entered f then you need to convert from celsius to fahrenheit.
        //
        // Create an if statement to check if they entered c or f.
        //
        // Hint: Remember that they could enter a capital or lowercase letter!
        // It's probably best to check for both.  if the unit is equal to c or the unit is equal to C
        //
        // Hint 2: You don't have to do two if statements, you could just do an if and an else.
        // If they chose c, then do the celsius conversion.
        // else, they must have chosen f.
        //
        // Step Three:
        // Next, ask the user what number they would like to convert.
        // Store their answer in a variable.
        //
        // "What value would you like to convert to? Enter a number."
        //
        // Step Four:
        // Now, for both celsius to fahrenheit and for fahrenheit to celsius, do the conversion!
        // Celsius to Fahrenheit:  Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32
        // Fahrenheit to Celsius:  Subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
        // in both the if and the else blocks, create a variable called result and assign the answer to it.
        //
        // Remember that in order to divide a number accurately, you must use a double!  If you use an int
        // then you will get no numbers after the decimal place...
        //
        // Step File:
        // Now print your answer to the browser window using System.out.println()
        //
        // It should look like:
        // ""22°C converted to Fahrenheit is 71.6°F"
        // or
        // ""71.6°F converted to Celsius is 22°C"
        //
        // Hint: Copy and paste the ° from here to put into your string.
        //
        // Note that some of your numbers may have many decimal places!
        // Like 76.266666666667, that's perfectly fine!  You can leave those as is.
        //
        // Write your code here


        System.out.println("Welcome to the Temperate Converter!");

        // Write your code here

    }
